It looks like a _hell_ of an effort to [add additional ServiceMonitors](https://github.com/prometheus-operator/kube-prometheus/blob/fcd8d01fa1a1179d665cbeacaf7e06a77971354b/docs/customizations/monitoring-additional-namespaces.md) (or, well...not [that](https://github.com/prometheus-operator/kube-prometheus/blob/main/docs/customizing.md) much effort, but it would still require a different process than the rest of the Helm Charts defined here, and so I'd rather stick with a process that's generalizable). Thus, this package exists to define "extra" components - such as the ServiceMonitor recommended by [this guide to monitoring Drone](https://cogarius.medium.com/3-3-complete-guide-to-ci-cd-pipelines-with-drone-io-on-kubernetes-drone-metrics-with-prometheus-c2668e42b03f).
