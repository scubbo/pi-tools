# Supporting services

Ombi, Sonarr, Radarr, and NzbGet do nothing in isolation - you need to hook them up to supporting services to access any data.

## Indexers

These are the services that translate search requests into sets of Usenet post addresses to be downloaded and collated.

I currently use:

* NzbPlanet

And have been advised to try:

* DrunkenSlug
* Nzb.su
* NZBFinder
* NZBGeek

## Providers

These are the services that host the actual data

I use:

* Usenetserver

And have been advised to try:

* usenet.farm
